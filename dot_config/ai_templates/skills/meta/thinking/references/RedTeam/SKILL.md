## Customization

If the current assistant supports user-specific overrides, apply them before execution. Otherwise, use the defaults in this folder.

## Status Update

Before executing, emit a brief text status update such as:
`Running the **WorkflowName** workflow in the **RedTeam** skill to ACTION...`

# RedTeam Skill

Military-grade adversarial analysis using parallel agent deployment. Breaks arguments into atomic components, attacks from 32 expert perspectives (engineers, architects, pentesters, interns), synthesizes findings, and produces devastating counter-arguments with steelman representations.


## Workflow Routing

Route to the appropriate workflow based on the request.

**When executing a workflow, output this notification directly:**

```
Running the **WorkflowName** workflow in the **RedTeam** skill to ACTION...
```

| Trigger | Workflow |
|---------|----------|
| Red team analysis (stress-test existing content) | `workflows/ParallelAnalysis.md` |
| Adversarial validation (produce new content via competition) | `workflows/AdversarialValidation.md` |

---

## Quick Reference

| Workflow | Purpose | Output |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **ParallelAnalysis** | Stress-test existing content | Steelman + Counter-argument (8-points each) |
| **AdversarialValidation** | Produce new content via competition | Synthesized solution from competing proposals |

**The Five-Phase Protocol (ParallelAnalysis):**
1. **Decomposition** - Break into 24 atomic claims
2. **Parallel Analysis** - 32 agents examine strengths AND weaknesses
3. **Synthesis** - Identify convergent insights
4. **Steelman** - Strongest version of the argument
5. **Counter-Argument** - Strongest rebuttal

## Examples

**Attack an architecture proposal:**
```
User: "red team this microservices migration plan"
--> workflows/ParallelAnalysis.md
--> Returns steelman + devastating counter-argument (8 points each)
```

**Devil's advocate on a business decision:**
```
User: "poke holes in my plan to raise prices 20%"
--> workflows/ParallelAnalysis.md
--> Surfaces the ONE core issue that could collapse the plan
```

**Adversarial validation for content:**
```
User: "battle of bots - which approach is better for this feature?"
--> workflows/AdversarialValidation.md
--> Synthesizes best solution from competing ideas
```
