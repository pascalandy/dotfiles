# World Threat Model Harness

A system of 11 persistent world models spanning 6 months to 50 years. Each model is a deep (~10 page)
analysis of geopolitics, technology, economics, society, environment, security, and wildcards for that
time horizon. Ideas, strategies, and investments are tested against ALL horizons simultaneously using
adversarial analysis (RedTeam, FirstPrinciples, Council).

## Workflow Routing

| Trigger | Workflow | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| "test idea", "test strategy", "test investment", "how will this hold up", "stress test", "test against future" | `workflows/TestIdea.md` | Test any input against all 11 world models |
| "update world model", "update models", "refresh models", "new analysis" | `workflows/UpdateModels.md` | Refresh world model content with new research/analysis |
| "view world model", "show models", "current models", "model status" | `workflows/ViewModels.md` | Read and summarize current world model state |

## Tier System

All workflows support three execution tiers:

| Tier | Target Time | Strategy | When to Use |
|------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Fast** | ~2 min | Single agent synthesizes across all models | Quick gut-check, casual exploration |
| **Standard** | ~10 min | One pass per horizon, parallel if available, plus RedTeam + FirstPrinciples | Most use cases, good depth/speed balance |
| **Deep** | Up to 1 hr | One pass per horizon with optional parallelism, plus deeper research, RedTeam, Council, and FirstPrinciples | High-stakes decisions, major investments |

**Default tier:** Standard. User specifies with "fast", "deep", or tier defaults to Standard.

## World Model Storage

By default, store models in a workspace-local `WorldModels/` directory. If the user specifies a different location, use that instead.

| File | Horizon |
|------|---------|
| `INDEX.md` | Summary of all models with last-updated dates |
| `6-month.md` | 6-month outlook |
| `1-year.md` | 1-year outlook |
| `2-year.md` | 2-year outlook |
| `3-year.md` | 3-year outlook |
| `5-year.md` | 5-year outlook |
| `7-year.md` | 7-year outlook |
| `10-year.md` | 10-year outlook |
| `15-year.md` | 15-year outlook |
| `20-year.md` | 20-year outlook |
| `30-year.md` | 30-year outlook |
| `50-year.md` | 50-year outlook |

## Context Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `references/ModelTemplate.md` | Template structure for world model documents |
| `references/OutputFormat.md` | Template for TestIdea results output |

## Skill Integrations

This skill works well with:

- **RedTeam** — Adversarial stress testing of ideas against each horizon
- **FirstPrinciples** — Decompose idea assumptions into hard/soft/assumption constraints
- **Council** — Multi-perspective debate on idea viability across horizons
- **Web research** — Current research for model creation and updates

## Status Update

Before any workflow execution, emit a brief text status update naming the workflow and current tier.

## Location Preference

If the user already has a preferred world-model directory, use it. Otherwise default to `WorldModels/` in the current workspace.
