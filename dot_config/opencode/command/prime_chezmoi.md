## Context

run `chezmoi cd`
Here the user manages his configs / **dotfiles** via cli `chezmoi`

## Process

Usually the user will have some kind of questions or he wants something to be updated in his config.
Once you updated the config, you should run :

- `chezmoi apply`
- commit (see how by using the commit skill)
- `git push`

## Diligence and investigation

- Using cli `gh` you have access to my repo https://github.com/pascalandy/dotfiles
