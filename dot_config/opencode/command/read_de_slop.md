description: De-slopify your README files and docs

I want you to read through the complete text carefully and look for any telltale signs of "AI slop" style writing; one big tell is the use of emdash. You should try to replace this with a semicolon, a comma, or just recast the sentence accordingly so it sounds good while avoiding emdash. 

Also, you want to avoid certain telltale writing tropes, like sentences of the form "It's not [just] XYZ, it's ABC" or "Here's why" or "Here's why it matters:".  Basically, anything that sounds like the kind of thing an LLM would write disproportionately more commonly that a human writer and which sounds inauthentic/cringe.

And you can't do this sort of thing using regex or a script, you MUST manually read each line of the text and revise it manually in a systematic, methodical, diligent way. Use ultrathink.
