## Q&A format with intelligent options

When you need to ask questions to the users, follow this dynamic:

I want you to interview me in order to clarify any ambiguities and make our specs ultra tight. Ask me one question at a time.

Provide options choices like : `1) .. 2) .. 4 ..` to make it super quick for the user to answer you. Show me your _recommanded_ answer between (). Also sort options choices with the highest probability on the top.

**IMPORTANT**: Each answers I provide, must inform the next question(s) you ask. Limit your number of questions to 7, so be strategic.

Once the interview is completed, based on our conversation, update every relevant file(s) and doc(s)

If you feel we need another round of questions, tell the user why using bullet points
