I want to explore with you a ways to find back some files that are missing in my actual vault. 

you have access to the cli `mgrep`. see the skill

let work under here: /EXPORT/obs_restore

this a list of all my missing files @missing_files_trimmed.md

I want to go one by one. your job is to help me to find the missing file in my snapshot. 

I want you to start with the most recent snapshot. Sometimes we have a perfect match, so this is cool. but sometimes I might have renamed the title a bit. So that's why I think MGREP will be very useful. 

Then when you find a match, you tell me where's the file, then you open file destination in finder using `open -R /path/to/file.md`

Again, we need to do this slowly, file by file. 

any questions before we start ?

plan, think

export the plan ./find_missing_file_one_by_one.md

let me approuve it, and then we can execute.
